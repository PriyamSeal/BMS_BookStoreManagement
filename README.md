# BMS_BookStoreManagement
I have used Angular CLI , you can download in using your cmd. For reference check some youtube videos. 
As a backend part used port 8082 and Oracle database(11g). You may change the application Properties if you are willing to use any such other database. I hope this would be helpful.
